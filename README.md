## Credit Score Project - Openclassrooms

This repository contains files to build and deploy an app to evaluate the risk for a customer to repay a loan and to understand which paramaters could be changed to remove the risk. 

The dataset used is available on this link : https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/home-credit-default-risk-extensive-eda/data.

An api has been build on pythonanywhere and the application has been made with streamlit : https://occreditscoreproject.streamlit.app/.
